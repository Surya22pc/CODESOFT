# Data science Task-1 Titani-Survival-Prediction
# README

## Project Overview

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Python. The notebook covers various steps, including data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. This guide will help you set up your environment and run the notebook successfully.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (listed below)

## Required Python Packages

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Alternatively, you can install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file provided in the project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `notebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualization code.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset(s) used in the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: A text file listing the required Python packages.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## How to Run the Jupyter Notebook

Follow these steps to run the Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**

   Start the Jupyter Notebook server from the project directory:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the Notebook**

   In your web browser, navigate to the Jupyter Notebook interface. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file by clicking on it.

5. **Run the Notebook**

   With the notebook open, you can run each cell by selecting it and pressing `Shift + Enter`. This will execute the code in the cell and move to the next one.

## Data Description

The dataset(s) used in this project are located in the `data/` directory. Detailed information about the dataset(s) is provided within the notebook. Make sure to review the data description section to understand the structure and contents of the data.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the notebook, consider the following:

- Ensure all required packages are installed correctly.
- Check that the dataset files are correctly placed in the `data/` directory.
- Verify your Python and Jupyter Notebook installations are up-to-date.

For any further issues, feel free to create an issue in the repository or contact the project maintainers.
